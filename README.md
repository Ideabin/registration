IdeaBin
==============

Well if you have reached here then either you know what this is or you are curious to know what this is. For those who don't know what this is let me explain.
IdeaBin, as the name suggests, it is a service through which you can share your ideas. Now, as answer to why would someone want to share their "precious ideas", will soon be explained in a blog post which will be linked here.

Now, if you are one of those brave ones who would like to share your ideas with the world, then you should read further.
How this whole process of idea sharing works can be explained through the following steps,

- Register yourself by sending a pull request to us with the required edits in the file named 'Users' of this repo. You will know what and how to fill when you open that file
- Now, to share your idea, make a Github gist with "#ideabin" in its description. You can include other details like tags related to your awesome idea along  with a description. By adding of "#ideabin" to the description field our bots will know that an idea is shared with the world. Now, what our bots will do is tweet the idea on behalf of [ideabinbot](https://twitter.com/ideabinbot) with a mention to you followed by the description and the tags (if tags are written in description in the form of twitter hashtags then they will be tweeted as hashtags) followed by the link to your gist. Thus, the idea will have a reach to the followers of ideabinbot and to the followers of the tags you mentioned in the description.
- Now, enjoy the show.
