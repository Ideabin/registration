IdeaBin
==============

IdeaBin, as the name suggests, is a service through which you can share your ideas. An answer to why would someone want to share their "precious ideas"? will soon be explained in a blog post (which will be linked here.)

To share your idea:

- Register yourself by sending a pull request to us with the required edits in the file named 'Users' of this repo. 
- To share your idea, make a Github gist with "#ideabin" in its description. You can include other details and tags in the description. 

By adding "#ideabin" to the description our bots will know that an idea needs to be shared with the world and will tweet it on behalf of [ideabinbot](https://twitter.com/ideabinbot) giving you a mention.

The tweet will also contain the description and the hashtags followed by the link to your gist. Thus, the idea will have a reach to the followers of ideabinbot and the hashtags you mentioned in the description.

To know more about our bots check out this repo - [Ideabin/bot](https://github.com/Ideabin/bot)

If you use Sublime Text then you can check out our Gist plugin which has some added features - [Ideabin/Gist](https://github.com/Ideabin/Gist)
